## What is this?

The Eclipse IDE is a modern and open IDE for cloud and desktop. The Theia IDE is based on the [Theia platform](https://theia-ide.org).
The Theia IDE is available as a [downloadable desktop application](https://theia-ide.org//#theiaidedownload). You can also try the latest version of the Theia IDE online. The online test version is limited to 30 minutes per session and hosted via Theia.cloud.

The Eclipse Theia IDE also serves as a **template** for building desktop-based products based on the Eclipse Theia platform, as well as to showcase Eclipse Theia capabilities. It is made up of a subset of existing Eclipse Theia features and extensions. [Documentation is available](https://theia-ide.org/docs/composing_applications/) to help you customize and build your own Eclipse Theia-based product.

## Theia IDE vs Theia Blueprint

The Theia IDE has been rebranded from its original name “Theia Blueprint”. To avoid any confusion, the repository and code artifacts will keep the name “Blueprint”. You can therefore assume the terms “Theia IDE” and “Theia Blueprint” to be synonymous.

## Development

### Requirements

Please check Theia's [prerequisites](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/doc/Developing.md#prerequisites), and keep node versions aligned between Theia IDE and that of the referenced Theia version.

### Documentation

Documentation on how to package Theia as a Desktop Product may be found [here](https://theia-ide.org/docs/blueprint_documentation/)

### Repository Structure

- Root level configures mono-repo build with lerna
- `applications` groups the different app targets
  - `browser` contains a browser based version of Eclipse Theia IDE that may be packaged as a Docker image
  - `electron` contains the electron app to package, packaging configuration, and E2E tests for the electron target.
- `theia-extensions` groups the various custom theia extensions for the Eclipse Theia IDE
  - `product` contains a Theia extension contributing the product branding (about dialogue and welcome page).
  - `updater` contains a Theia extension contributing the update mechanism and corresponding UI elements (based on the electron updater).
  - `launcher` contains a Theia extension contributing, for AppImage applications, the option to create a script that allows to start the Eclipse Theia IDE from the command line by calling the 'theia' command.

### Build

For development and casual testing of the Eclipse Theia IDE, one can build it in "dev" mode. This permits building the IDE on systems with less resources, like a Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB of RAM.

```sh
# Build "dev" version of the app. Its quicker, uses less resources, 
# but the front end app is not "minified"
yarn && yarn build:dev && yarn download:plugins
```

Production applications:

```sh
# Build production version of the Eclipse Theia IDE app
yarn && yarn build && yarn download:plugins
```

### Package the Applications

ATM we only produce packages for the Electron application.

```sh
yarn package:applications
# or
yarn electron package
```

The packaged application is located in `applications/electron/dist`.

### Create a Preview Electron Electron Application (without packaging it)

```sh
yarn electron package:preview
```

The packaged application is located in `applications/electron/dist`.

### Running E2E Tests on Electron

The E2E tests basic UI tests of the actual application.
This is done based on the preview of the packaged application.

```sh
yarn electron package:preview
yarn electron test
```

### Running Browser app

The browser app may be started with

```sh
yarn browser start
```

and connect to <http://localhost:3000/>

### Troubleshooting

- [_"Don't expect that you can build app for all platforms on one platform."_](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build)

### Reporting Feature Requests and Bugs

The features in the Eclipse Theia IDE are based on Theia and the included extensions/plugins. For bugs in Theia please consider opening an issue in the [Theia project on Github](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/issues/new/choose).
The Eclipse Theia IDE only packages existing functionality into a product and installers for the product. If you believe there is a mistake in packaging, something needs to be added to the packaging or the installers do not work properly, please [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia-blueprint/issues/new/choose) to let us know.

### Docker Build

You can create a Docker Image for the Eclipse Theia IDE based on the browser app with the following build command:

```sh
docker build -t theia-ide -f browser.Dockerfile .
```

You may then run this with

```sh
docker run -p=3000:3000 --rm theia-ide
```

and connect to <http://localhost:3000/>
