            Theia Blueprint assembles a selected subset of existing Theia features and extensions. We
            provide installers for Theia Blueprint to be downloaded (see below) as well
            as <a href='https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia-blueprint' target='_blank'>documentation</a> on
